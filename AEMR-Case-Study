Part 1: Energy Stability and Market Outages

Energy stability is one of the key themes the AEMR management team cares about. To ensure energy security and reliability, AEMR needs to understand the following:

What are the most common outage types and how long do they tend to last?
How frequently do the outages occur?
Are there any energy providers that have more outages than their peers which may indicate that these providers are unreliable?

These questions have been broken down into more detail below. Please download a copy of the dataset located here.
Note about using the dataset: The column names supplied in the sample tables must exactly match the column names in your SQL query. This is because the platform is CASE SENSITIVE. If they do not match, the Next.Tech Checker will not mark your query as correct even if the numbers are correct but the column names are different.
Please note that for the whole AEMR Case Study we are only interested in the Outages where the Status = Approved.
Upon completing all these questions, download the AEMR.csv file and use this in Tableau/PowerBI to craft your story. You can check your answers you've created using the .csv files you've downloaded from each of the Queries you've completed.
Let's get started!


---------------------

Question 1.1: In the AEMR dataset, write a SQL statement that COUNTS the number of valid (i.e. Status = Approved) outage events for 2016. This should be grouped by and ordered by the outage reason. The output of your query should have the following column headers:
Please note that we are expecting you to use YEAR() as opposed to EXTRACT() when working with the Start_Time column.
We've included a refresher on the SQL Syntax provided here:

SELECT FROM WHERE GROUP BY ORDER BY

*
SELECT COUNT(Status='Approved') AS Total_Number_Outage_Events, Status, Reason
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved' AND YEAR(Start_Time)=2016
GROUP BY Status, Reason
ORDER BY Reason
*

---------------------

Question 1.2: Which outage type occurred most frequently in 2016?

*
Forced
*

---------------------

Question 1.3: Write a SQL statement to COUNT the number of valid (i.e. Status = Approved) outage events sorted by their reason (i.e. Forced, Consequential, Scheduled, Opportunistic)* for 2017.
The output of your query should have the following column headers:

Total_Number_Outage_Events | Status | Reason

*
SELECT COUNT(Status='Approved') AS Total_Number_Outage_Events, Status, Reason
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved' AND YEAR(Start_Time)=2017
GROUP BY Status, Reason
ORDER BY Reason
*

---------------------

Question 1.4: Which outage type occurred the least in 2017?

*
Opportunistic Maintenance (Planned)
*

---------------------

Question 1.5: Write a SQL statement that calculates the average duration in days rounded to 2 decimal places for each approved outage type across both 2016 and 2017. Don't forget to Order this by Reason and Year.
Please note: The average duration in days should be rounded to 2 decimal places for ease of comparison. Additionally, include the overall count of outage events per outage type (i.e. Forced, Consequential, Planned, Opportunistic).
You may find the function TIMESTAMPDIFF() here to be very helpful! Look at the Unit argument and think carefully regarding how we might be able to convert this to days.
We've included a hint below to help guide your thinking:

TIMESTAMPDIFF(__) / 60 = Hours

How could we convert this to Days?
Please note you should not use the unit DAY as this will round up to the nearest day which will result inaccuracies
The output of your query should have the following column headers:

Status | Reason | Total_Number_Outage_Events | Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Days | Year

*
SELECT Status, Reason, COUNT(*) as Total_Number_Outage_Events,ROUND(AVG((TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, Start_Time, End_Time)/60)/24),2) AS Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Days,YEAR(Start_Time) as Year
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved'
GROUP BY Status, Reason, YEAR(Start_Time)
ORDER BY YEAR(Start_Time), Reason
*

---------------------

Question 2.1: Write a SQL statement showing the monthly COUNT of all approved outage types (Forced, Consequential, Scheduled, Opportunistic) that occurred for 2016. Order by Reason and Month.
The output of your query should have the following column headers:

Status | Reason | Total_Number_Outage_Events | Month

*
SELECT Status, Reason, COUNT(*) as Total_Number_Outage_Events, MONTH(Start_Time) as Month
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved' AND YEAR(Start_Time)=2016
GROUP BY Status, Reason, Month(Start_Time)
ORDER BY Reason, Month
*

---------------------

Question 2.2: Write a SQL Statement showing the monthly COUNT of all approved outage types (Forced, Consequential, Scheduled, Opportunistic) that occurred during 2017. Order by Reason and Month.
The output of your query should have the following column headers:

Status | Reason | Total_Number_Outage_Events | Month

*
SELECT Status, Reason, COUNT(*) as Total_Number_Outage_Events, MONTH(Start_Time) as Month
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved' AND YEAR(Start_Time)=2017
GROUP BY Status, Reason, MONTH(Start_Time)
ORDER BY Reason, Month
*

---------------------

Question 2.3: Write a SQL statement showing the total number of all approved outage types (Forced, Consequential, Scheduled, Opportunistic) that occurred for both 2016 and 2017 per month (i.e. 1 â€“ 12). Don't forget to Order this by by Month and Year.
The output of your query should have the following column headers:

Status | Total_Number_Outage_Events | Month | Year

*
SELECT Status, COUNT(*) as Total_Number_Outage_Events, MONTH(Start_Time) as Month, YEAR(Start_Time) as Year
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved'
GROUP BY Status, MONTH(Start_Time), YEAR(Start_Time)
ORDER BY YEAR(Start_Time), MONTH(Start_Time)
*

---------------------

Question 3.1: Write a SQL statement showing the count of all approved outage types (Forced, Consequential, Scheduled, Opportunistic) for all participant codes for 2016 and 2017. Order by Year and Participant_Code.
The output of your query should have the following column headers:

Total_Number_Outage_Events | Participant_Code | Status | Year

*
SELECT COUNT(*) as Total_Number_Outage_Events, Participant_Code, Status, YEAR(Start_Time) as Year
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved'
GROUP BY Participant_Code, Status, YEAR(Start_Time)
ORDER BY YEAR(Start_Time), Participant_Code
*

---------------------

Question 3.2: Write a SQL statement showing the average duration of all approved outage types (Forced, Consequential, Scheduled, Opportunistic) for all participant codes from 2016 to 2017. Don't forget to order the average duration in descending order with the DESC keyword.

Hints:
Use TIMESTAMPDIFF function to return the time value.
Please note that the time is less than one day, so you need to calculate minutes and convert to days. Don't forget to use ROUND() to ensure your answer is rounded to 2 decimal places.
The output of your query should have the following column headers:

Participant_Code | Status | Year | Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Days

*
SELECT Participant_Code, Status, YEAR(Start_Time) as Year ,ROUND(AVG((TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, Start_Time, End_Time)/60)/24),2) AS Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Days
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved'
GROUP BY Participant_Code, Status, Year(Start_Time)
ORDER BY YEAR(Start_Time), CAST(Avg(CAST(TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY,Start_Time,End_Time)AS DECIMAL(18,2))) AS DECIMAL(18,2)) DESC
*
